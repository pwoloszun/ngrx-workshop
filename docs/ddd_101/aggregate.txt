Aggregate = Aggregate Root + Aggregate Boundary

Aggregate:
Aggregate consists of an aggregate root and a boundary.

For example, the relationship between Order and OrderLineItem within SalesOrderDomain
can be considered as an aggregate where Order acts as the aggregate root,
while the OrderLineItem is the child of Order within SalesOrder boundary.

IMPORTANT:
1) Aggregate root is a facade, which encapsulates both:
- app/business logic AND
- child entities (i.e. you canâ€™t access the child directly).
2) Aggregate defines a transactional boundary. This means any changes to the aggregate will either all succeed or none will succeed.
3) Almost all operations within (sub)domains should go through an aggregate root (AR).

IMPORTANT:
Relationship does NOT equal Aggregate

Ask Question:
Why would I need to treat this cluster of objects as a unit?

Correct Answer:
You have aggregate when you have business rules - that govern the relationship of those objects.
